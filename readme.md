# DHT2x Protocol Analyzer for Saleae Logic
This plugin implements a 1-wire like decoder. Default timings are based on the datasheet. The decoder is a simple threshold detector which checks HIGH pulse duration. Anything above (One_duration+Zero_duration)/2 is considered 1 and below is 0. There is cehcking for the host start signal which is any LOW duration > 1 ms. The decoder expects a message length of 40 bits in total (not including the initial host/sensor hand shaking).


# Build Instructions
To build on Windows, open the visual studio project in the Visual Studio folder, and build. The Visual Studio solution has configurations for 32 bit and 64 bit builds. You will likely need to switch the configuration to 64 bit and build that in order to get the analyzer to load in the Windows software.

To build on Linux or OSX, run the build_analyzer.py script. The compiled libraries can be found in the newly created debug and release folders.

	python build_analyzer.py

To debug on Windows, please first review the article here:

[How do I develop custom analyzers for the Logic software on Windows?](http://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/articles/208666946)

On Windows, it is not possible to attach a debugger to the latest software. In order to debug custom analyzers on Windows, you need to use an older version of the Windows software.
Specifically, you will need the Saleae Logic 1.1.18 Windows 32 bit standalone release. You can find it here:

[Older Saleae Logic Beta Downloads](http://support.saleae.com/hc/en-us/articles/210245603)

You will also need the 1.1.14 SDK, the last SDK release to support software versions 1.1.14-1.1.18. That is available on a separate branch of the Saleae AnalyzerSDK Github repository. Simply change the submodule configuration to point to that branch, and the existing visual studio project will just work. Be sure to only compile for 32 bit, since the 1.1.14 SDK was released before Saleae began targeting 64 bit Windows. This is also why the 32 bit standalone version of the 1.1.18 software is required.
It's also worth noting that you should use a #define and #ifdef to remove the contents of your Analyzer's GenerateFrameTabularText methods, because the methods ClearTabularText and AddTabularText were not yet present in the 1.1.14 SDK.

The Sample Analyzer Project also contains a branch, 1.1.14-for-win32-debug, which already contains the updated git submodule branch. Simply merge your changes into that branch, and then you will not need to switch submodule branches.

In the future, I would like to update this so that no branch changes are required, and the visual studio project just contains configurations for both the latest SDK and the 1.1.14 SDK.
